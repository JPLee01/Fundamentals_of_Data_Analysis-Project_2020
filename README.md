## 1 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the Project for the Fundamentals for Data Analysis module a Jupyter Notebook has been created to perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the *powerproduction* dataset. This notebook will investigate XXXXXX. While also XXXXX. This analysis will be conducted through a Jupyter Notebook which will contain markdown text, images, Python code and Plots. 

## 2 Project Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Project Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the project will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020):

  **File**    |     **Description**
  ---------   |   --------------------------------------------------------
  .gitignore | A Text File explicitly explaining to Git which files or folders to ignore in the Assignment
  Project Instructions.pdf | A PDF copy of the Poject Instructions
  LICENSE     |    MIT License for the project
  Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Project.ipynb | Jupyter Notebook created to  in Python

## 3  Powerproduction Dataset
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 XXXX 

## 4 Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the project, the student was given a set of instructions which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020/blob/main/Project%20Instructions.pdf). As seen, within the instructions a problem statement was printed. It stated that XXXX. Specifically, the instruction state the project should:
* Performing simple linear regression on the *powerproduction* data set.
* An explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
* Research and investigation into other types of regression on the *powerproduction* data set and an analysis of its accuracy.

## 5 User Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section will describe the steps required to download and run the files in the repository.

### 5.1 Downloading the Repository
The repository is stored at the following: https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020)

To download the repository, do the following:
1.  Click on the above link to open the repository
2.  Once in the repository, click on the green “clone or download” button on the right side of the screen.
3.  Select "Download ZIP". This will open a prompt allowing you to save the file to a desired location on your computer.
4.  Navigate to where  the ZIP files are located on your computer and extract the compressed (.zip) files.

### 5.2 Running the Program
Once the repository has been downloaded, you will need to ensure that you are running it in the correct environment. It should be noted that this repository has been written using Python 3.8.2 and consequently it will require a Python version of 3.7 at a minimum to run as designed. The repository also requires a number of external Python libraries [seen below](#5.3-Libaries) to execute correctly. Once the correct version of Python has been installed complete with necessary libraries and the ZIP has been downloaded and extracted the user can run the program. The running of any of the programs from the command line can be executed as follows:
1.  Open a command prompt (cmd) or equivalent on your computer.([Cmdr](https://cmder.net) is recommended for Windows computers, Mac Computers via the terminal)
2.  Navigate to the desired location through the use of the change directory (cd) command.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook by typing the following at the command prompt (do not close the command prompt window throughout):
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. A notebook server should automatically launch in your default web browser (URL should be http://localhost:8888). If this does not happen, read the command prompt output. You can copy and paste the above URL into your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.
6. Using the menu on the left side of the page, double click the jupyter notebook file:
```
Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020.ipynb
```
7. The notebook should open in a new tab. You can run each cell with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ENTER, alternatively use the "play" button on the menu bar. Please note that certain cells must be run before others e.g. the cells importing the various Python libraries. You may find it convenient to use the "Run all Cells" option in the "Run" dropdown menu.

### 5.3 Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in the writing of the projects code and are required to successfully run the programs:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - Used for mathematical functions in the [Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020/blob/main/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Project%202020.ipynb) notebook.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for import, management, data manipulation and analysis in the [Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020/blob/main/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Project%202020.ipynb) notebook.
* [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) - Used for the manipulation of elements and the creation of certain plots graphs, plots and charts within the [Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020/blob/main/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Project%202020.ipynb) notebook.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Used for the creation and manipulation of all plots in the [Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2020.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project_2020/blob/main/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Project%202020.ipynb) notebook. (Seaborn allows for the extetion of the functionality of Matplotlib).
